# CODEOWNERS File for Git Training Repository
#
# This file defines code ownership and automatic review request assignments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
#
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies files they own. When branch protection requires code owner reviews,
# the pull request cannot be merged until a code owner approves it.
#
# More information: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# GLOBAL OWNERSHIP

# NEWBIE LEVEL - Basic Git Skills Team
# ==============================================================================
# Files in newbie branch or newbie-related paths
# Review team: Instructors who evaluate basic Git competency
# Trainees working on newbie exercises will need approval from this team

# Pattern matches branches like: newbie, group-*-outcomes/newbie, feature/newbie-*

# ==============================================================================
# INTERMEDIATE LEVEL - Collaboration Skills Team
# ==============================================================================
# Files in intermediate branch or intermediate-related paths
# Review team: Instructors who evaluate collaboration and conflict resolution
# Trainees must demonstrate merge conflict resolution skills

# ==============================================================================
# MASTER LEVEL - Advanced Git Team
# ==============================================================================
# Files in master branch or master-related paths
# Review team: Senior instructors who evaluate advanced techniques
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR TRAINEES:
# This is where trainees will discover that their pull requests for the
# "Advanced branching strategies" exercise REQUIRE code owner approval.
# This is intentional - understanding code ownership is part of mastering
# professional Git workflows (Git Flow, GitHub Flow).
#
# Trainees should:
# 1. Attempt to merge their branching strategy implementation
# 2. Discover they need code owner approval
# 3. Research CODEOWNERS files and their role in Git workflows
# 4. Request proper reviews following the workflow they're implementing
# 5. Understand how this integrates with branch protection rules

# TEAMS REFERENCE
# ==============================================================================
#
# GitHub Teams that should be created in the organization:
#
# @miguel-oltra              - Repository owner and lead instructor
# @newbie-reviewers          - Team reviewing basic Git exercises
# @intermediate-reviewers    - Team reviewing collaboration exercises
# @master-reviewers          - Team reviewing advanced Git techniques
# @git-flow-experts          - Specialists in branching strategies (CRITICAL for discovery exercise)
# @security-team             - Security experts for Master of Universe level
# @governance-team           - Repository governance and policy enforcers
#
# Note: If using personal repository instead of organization, replace team names
# with individual GitHub usernames (e.g., @reviewer1, @reviewer2)
#
# ==============================================================================
# LEARNING OBJECTIVE
# ==============================================================================
#
# This CODEOWNERS file is designed to create a "discovery moment" for trainees:
#
# When working on the Master level "Advanced branching strategies" exercise,
# trainees will implement Git Flow or GitHub Flow. When they attempt to merge
# their work, they'll encounter CODEOWNERS requirements.
#
# This teaches them:
# 1. Code ownership is part of professional Git workflows
# 2. Branch protection and code ownership work together
# 3. Pull request workflows in enterprise environments
# 4. How to identify and request appropriate reviewers
# 5. The connection between Git Flow/GitHub Flow and code review processes
#
# The file is intentionally NOT documented in the exercise instructions,
# requiring trainees to research and understand it independently.
