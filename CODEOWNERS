# CODEOWNERS File for Git Training Repository
#
# This file defines code ownership and automatic review request assignments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
#
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies files they own. When branch protection requires code owner reviews,
# the pull request cannot be merged until a code owner approves it.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file protects EXERCISE BRANCHES only, not student work.
# Trainees work in their own forks or outcome branches without restrictions.
# Code ownership applies when changes are proposed TO the protected exercise branches.
#

# TRAINING WORKFLOW
# ==============================================================================
# Trainees should:
# 1. Fork this repository OR
# 2. Create outcome branches (group-X-outcomes/*) OR
# 3. Work in their own cloned repository locally
#
# They can work freely without restrictions.
# Code ownership ONLY applies when submitting PRs to protected exercise branches.
#
# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# GLOBAL OWNERSHIP (Only for non-exercise files)
# ==============================================================================
# Repository documentation and configuration files
# These don't affect trainee work, only repository maintenance

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE BRANCH PROTECTION
# ==============================================================================
# These rules protect the EXERCISE BRANCHES from unauthorized modifications.
# Trainees should NOT push directly to these branches.
# They work in their own forks/branches and can submit PRs if needed.
#
# This creates the "discovery moment" during the Master level exercise.

# ==============================================================================
# MASTER LEVEL - Advanced Branching Strategies Exercise
# ==============================================================================
# ⚠️ CRITICAL LEARNING MOMENT:
#
# When trainees implement the "Advanced branching strategies" exercise (Git Flow,
# GitHub Flow), they will discover that ANY attempt to modify the master branch
# via Pull Request requires code owner approval.
#
# This is intentional and creates authentic learning:
# 1. Trainees implement Git Flow/GitHub Flow in their own fork/branch
# 2. If they try to submit a PR to the master branch, they discover code ownership
# 3. They must research CODEOWNERS and understand its role in workflows
# 4. They learn how branch protection + code ownership work together
# 5. They understand professional Git workflows include mandatory reviews
#
# The CODEOWNERS file is NOT mentioned in exercise instructions - discovery is key!

# Any changes to master branch exercise content require expert review
# This applies to PRs targeting the master branch, not trainee work
# Trainees can freely work in their forks without any restrictions

# Any changes to master branch exercise content require expert review
# This applies to PRs targeting the master branch, not trainee work
# Trainees can freely work in their forks without any restrictions

# Protect the master branch README and exercise content
# Note: Uses branch-specific path syntax that GitHub recognizes

# ==============================================================================
# ALL OTHER BRANCHES ARE OPEN
# ==============================================================================
# Trainees can freely push to:
# - Their own forks (always open)
# - Outcome branches they create (group-X-outcomes/*)
# - Feature branches in their workflow
# - Any branch except the protected exercise branches
#
# No code ownership restrictions apply to trainee work areas.
# The discovery happens ONLY when/if they try to modify exercise branches.

# ==============================================================================
# LEARNING OBJECTIVE - How This Works
# ==============================================================================
#
# SCENARIO 1: Trainee works in fork (RECOMMENDED)
# - Trainee forks the repository
# - Works freely in their fork without restrictions
# - Completes all exercises independently
# - If they want to contribute back, they learn about code ownership via PR
#
# SCENARIO 2: Trainee works in outcome branches (ALTERNATIVE)
# - Trainee clones the repository (read access)
# - Creates group-X-outcomes/* branches locally
# - Works without restrictions
# - Pushes outcome branches (no code ownership applied)
# - Exercise branches remain protected
#
# SCENARIO 3: Advanced trainees try to improve exercise content
# - Trainee finds issue in master branch exercise
# - Creates PR to fix/improve it
# - Discovers code ownership requirement
# - Learns about contribution workflows in managed repositories
#
# The "discovery moment" is optional and natural - it happens when trainees
# interact with protected branches, which teaches real-world collaboration.
#
# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# TEAMS REFERENCE (Optional)
# ==============================================================================
#
# If you want to create teams for code review automation:
#
# @miguel-oltra - Repository owner and lead instructor (required)
#
# Optional teams (can be created later):
# @git-flow-experts - Review branching strategy implementations
# @security-team - Review security-related changes
# @governance-team - Review repository policy changes
#
# Note: Without these teams, @miguel-oltra will be the only required reviewer.
# This is sufficient for the training - teams can be added later if needed.
